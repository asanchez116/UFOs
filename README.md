# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic website that can display table information about UFO sightings that is filterable by location, date and type of sighting. 

## Results 
Data can be filtered by entering the date, city state country and shape of sighting to pull entries that match the entered criteria. This can be helpful to detrmine locations with frequent sightings, the types of sightings that occure most frequently as well as times of year that one might be more likely to encounter a UFO as well as any combination of available filter options.

## Summary
One drawback is the single entry date filter. Having the option to at a range of dates can be helpful. 
Two additional recommendations:

* Providing a second date search entry in case the user wants to search for a date range instead of a single date

* Providing a "clear" button to erase the entries making reuse easier.
